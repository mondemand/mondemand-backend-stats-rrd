% From RRDCACHED manpage
% The daemon answers with a line consisting of a status code and a short
% status message, separated by one or more space characters. A negative
% status code signals an error, a positive status code or zero signal
% success. If the status code is greater than zero, it indicates the
% number of lines that follow the status line.
%
% Examples:
%
%   0 Success<LF>
%
%   2 Two lines follow<LF>
%   This is the first line<LF>
%   And this is the second line<LF>
%

% Command processing is finished when the client sends a dot (".") on
% its own line.  After the client has finished, the server responds
% with an error count and the list of error messages (if any).  Each
% error messages indicates the number of the command to which it
% corresponds, and the error message itself.  The first user command
% after BATCH is command number one.
